============================================================================================
aim to clean
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset for further analysis
especailly we need the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
thess are 5 steps we should go through to cleaning the data set
============================================================================================

step 1 :
     Read all the usful files into R studio
     Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

step 2 :
     Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
     Fist, extract mean of each measurement and then standard deviation, finally merge them together

step 3 :
     The data set is about human activity, so we are going to name the activities in the data set
  descriptive activity names rather than numeric labels
  
step 4 :
     Variable names are kind of mess, which is not a ideal form for further analysis,
     We are going to seperate them by "_"
     
step 5 : 
     From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
  of each variable for each activity and each subject
     Our data set is going to group by activities and caculate their means of each column one by one
  and merge them together
  
Wish what I said make sense to you
Appreciate your time !
